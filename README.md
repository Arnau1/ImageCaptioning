# ImageCaptioning

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images

This dataset was created by scraping from the Epicurious Website. Epicurious is an American digital brand that focuses on food and cooking-related topics. The scrapped content consists of 13,582 recipes that have:

    Title: Represents the Title of the Food Dish.
    Ingredients: Contains the ingredients as they were scraped from the website.
    Instructions: Has the recipe instructions to be followed to recreate the dish.
    Image_Name: Has the name of the image as stored in the Food Images zipped folder.
    Cleaned_Ingredients: Contains the ingredients after being processed and cleaned

The Epicurious website had many more recipes, but only these many out of them had images associated with them.
For our project we will start trying to predict the title given the image. If we have more time, we would try to predict other scrapped items.
